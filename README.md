# SV (String View)
 A simple C String View library

## How to use this?
Copy `sv.h` to your project.

In one of the source files, write `#define SV_IMPLEMENTATION` and then `#include "sv.h"`.

And now you're good to go! âœ¨

## Example
In `test.c` you can see some code that uses functions from `sv`. Use it to learn how to use this implementation. ðŸš€
